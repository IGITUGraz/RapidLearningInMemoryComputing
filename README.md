## Setup
You need [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to run this code. We used Python 3.9 and TensorFlow 2.5. See the corresponding [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) `environment.yml` file to install all necessary dependencies: 

    conda env create --file=environment.yml --name RapidLearningInMemoryComputing
    conda activate RapidLearningInMemoryComputing
    pip install --no-warn-conflicts -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Few-shot image classification with PCM-based neuromorphic hardware
To start training on the few-shot image classification task, run 

    cd few_shot_image_classification
    python main.py --seed 1234 --batch_size=32 --hidden_channels=56 --noise=False

To load an existing checkpoint, run

    cd few_shot_image_classification
    python main_omniglot.py --checkpoint checkpoints/pretrained-weights.pickle --seed 42  --batch_size=1 --hidden_channels=56 --noise=False --dataset_seed=128

### Rapid online learning of robot arm trajectories in biologically-inspired neural networks

To start training on the robotic arm online learning task, run 

    cd online_learning_robot
    python main.py

To load an existing checkpoint, run 
    
    cd online_learning_robot
    python main.py --checkpoint checkpoints/pretrained-weights.pickle
